# RSS or Really Simple Style
###  Theme for WordPress
#### version v1.2.0
---
This theme was thrown together in a few days; having previously created [travisfantina-2017](https://github.com/tfantina/travisfantina-2017) I was
unhappy with the design and wanted a simpler web presence as well as something
 also that could be more flexible for others if they wanted to use the theme.
Really Simple Style (RSS) aims to be extremely minimalist and lightweight.
Background colours can easily be modified in the WordPress customizer as can
"foreground colour".  By "foreground colour" is labeled as "text" in the customizer
but changing text will also change the color of headers, borders, icons and links.
This not only enforces a coherent and, hopefully, beautifully minimal design but
also makes customizations easy for the user.

As with the last theme I created I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out
to those who helped with this theme, specifically a fantastic article
 that helped me navigate through writing my first customizers. [By Daniel Pataki](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-theme-customizer-guide/)üëè

## Current issues
It should be noted that this theme is yet finished, it does not currently
comply with WordPress standards and as such should not yet be distributed.

Below are a few issues:

1. Multiple text domains
2. Not formatted for images
