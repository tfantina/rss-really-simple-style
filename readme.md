###  Theme for WordPress
#### version v1.2.2
---
The bulk of this theme was created over the course of a few days in November '17.  Having previously created [travisfantina-2017](https://github.com/tfantina/travisfantina-2017) I was
unhappy with the design and wanted a simpler web presence as well as something
 also that could be more flexible for others if they wanted to use the theme.
If you'd like you can see a live version of the theme [here](http://www.travisfantina.com/); it's what I'm using on my site right now!

Really Simple Style (RSS) aims to be extremely minimalist and lightweight.
Background colours can easily be modified in the WordPress customizer as can
"foreground colour".  By "foreground colour" is labeled as "text" in the customizer
but changing text will also change the color of headers, borders, icons and links.
This not only enforces a coherent and, hopefully, beautifully minimal design but
also makes customizations easy for the user.

As with the last theme I created I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out
to those who helped with this theme, specifically a fantastic article
 that helped me navigate through writing my first customizers. [By Daniel Pataki](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-theme-customizer-guide/)üëè
